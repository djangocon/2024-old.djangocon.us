      <p>Organizing DjangoCon US 2024 has begun! We need organizers to help make DjangoCon US 2024 the best it can be.</p>
<p>We have some <a href="https://djangocon.github.io/djangocon-us-docs/">documentation about the various roles</a>, but here's a quick overview of the teams at DjangoCon US.</p>
<p>The DEFNA board will not leave you stranded; we have a lot of documentation to help you on your way, including rough checklists of tasks needed for each team.</p>
<p>Ideally, all committees will have a chair and co-chair to allow for one or the other to take vacations, handle day job duties, and so forth. This list is by no means comprehensive, but it should hopefully give you an idea of what each committee is responsible for.</p>
<h2>Conference Leadership</h2>
<p>The conference chair and co-chair lead the conference, including coordinating between teams and making executive decisions (including approaching the DEFNA board when applicable). Expect to be in meetings with the venue and online conference provider, weekly organizer check-ins, monthly reports to the DEFNA board, and lots of questions on Slack. You'll also lead the volunteer kickoff meetings in early 2024 (ideally mid-to-late January) and recruit organizers as you see fit. You'll need to recommend an online conference provider to the DEFNA board (might be part of a sponsorship deal).</p>
<p>At the conference, you'll be making speeches at the start of each day and the end-of-conference wrap-up in addition to coordinating setup, teardown, and everything in between.</p>
<p>These two roles have the highest time commitment and the most visibility. If you want to help people get things done and get up on stage, these are the roles for you.</p>
<h2>Program Committee</h2>
<p>Size: 2-4</p>
<p>The program committee is responsible for making sure that the schedule of tutorials and talks is the best it can be.</p>
<h3>Pre-conference responsibilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start the call for proposals process (opened in March 2024, closes April 29)</li>
<li>Coordinate with the Opportunity Grants team to schedule the opening and closing of the CFP</li>
<li>Publish blog posts announcing the CFP, speaker mentors, and speaker resources</li>
<li>Recruit keynote speakers (the DEFNA board will offer suggestions, but if you have a message you'd like the keynotes to send, you have lots of latitude here, but keep in mind conference diversity goals)</li>
<li>Recruit speaker mentors (start with the 2019, 2021, and 2022 reviewers and bring in more as you like)</li>
<li>Review proposals as they come in for anonymization (ideally, recruit one member of the program committee who will not be reviewing talks to do the anonymization before opening talks for review)</li>
<li>Recruit talk reviewers (the DEFNA board will send you the 2023 reviewers, but more reviewers are encouraged, especially from diverse backgrounds). There will likely be over 100 submissions, so having more reviewers lessens the load for individual talks</li>
<li>Decide on any tweaks to the format (Spanish-language talks? Keep the Deep Dive Day? This is your chance to put your mark on the program)</li>
<li>Review talks</li>
<li>Once reviews are completed, de-anonymize talks and filter for duplicate speakers, multiple speakers from the same organization, diversity goals, overlapping topics, and more</li>
<li>Select the best talks (where &quot;best&quot; is extremely subjective; we have documentation on things we look for in good proposals); you're not strictly bound to pick the highest scoring talks, so you have some leeway</li>
<li>Coordinate with the Opportunity Grants team to send them a list of accepted speakers so they can prioritize them for awards</li>
<li>Coordinate with the OG team to notify speakers in waves (ideally completed by July 1)</li>
<li>Build a schedule (ideally by July 15)</li>
<li>Publish blog posts announcing speakers and keynotes (ideally by August 15)</li>
<li>Update schedules based on speakers' needs</li>
<li>Coordinate with the DEFNA board to approve reimbursement requests</li>
<li>Generate cue sheets for session chairs and speaker mentors</li>
<li>Review online talks for Code of Conduct compliance</li>
<li>Recruit backup speakers in case of speakers having to back out (visa issues, illness, etc.)</li>
<li>Work with the social events team to arrange a speaker appreciation dinner</li>
<li>Generate spreadsheets in multiple formats to make other teams' lives easier</li>
</ul>
