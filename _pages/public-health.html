            <p>
              In order to keep conference attendees safe, DjangoCon US will require proof
              of a negative COVID test. We ask that people test again before sprints begin
              on Thursday. We strongly recommend that people wear a mask and
              have the latest vaccination boosters. If you are not familiar, we suggest you check out
              the <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/covid19">CDC's Travel guidelines to stay safe</a>.
              <br />
              <br />
              The conference will feature select areas in the conference halls where attendees
              will be required to wear masks.
              <br />
              <br />
              We are requiring a negative test before coming to the registration desk on your
              first day of attendance. If you are taking a rapid test, you must take it within
              24 hours of your first ticketed day. We will have tests on site if you wish to
              test when you arrive. If you are taking a PCR test, it must be within 3 days of
              your first ticketed day (e.g. if you are attending Sunday's sessions, the test
              must be taken no earlier than Wednesday, September 18).
              <br />
              <br />
              We will be sending the testing instructions to in-person ticket-holders prior to the conference.
              <br />
              <br />
              The conference will provide <a href="https://www.stauffersafety.com/Product/3m-9205-bulk-3m-aura-n95-particulate-respirator-mask-701199" target="_blank">KN95 and/or N95 masks</a>
              for people to wear. We recommend that all
              attendees wear a certified KN95 / N95 respirator mask (with no outflow vent) while inside.
              If you prefer to wear a surgical mask, that is allowed. If you prefer to purchase your own
              PPE, DjangoCon US is offering a $50 reimbursement. Please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact_us_email}}">email us</a>
              to coordinate.
              <br />
              <br />
              DjangoCon US reserves the right to change this policy based on COVID-19 infection,
              hospitalization and death rates.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you have questions about the COVID-19 policy, please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact_us_email}}">email us</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              A short-version of the policy is as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Negative test to enter conference</li>
              <li>Test again before sprints</li>
              <li>Masks are recommended</li>
              <li>Specific seating areas that will require masks</li>

          <p>
            We're asking that all registrants go through the COVID-19 check-in process before registration.
            The COVID-19 registration area will consist of two tables, one for taking tests and the other
            for showing proof of a negative test. Further on will be the conference
            registration desk with your badge.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Acquire recommended N95/KN95 equivalent mask (we have them at the table)</li>
            <li>Take COVID-19 test (follow instructions on the box, perform the test at secondary table or at home/the hotel)</li>
            <li>Show test result or photo of negative test at COVID-19 desk with handwritten note containing the date</li>
            <li>Proceed to registration desk</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            If you have taken a test 24 hours within the start of the conference, you do not have to take
            another test. Here is an example of a negative test with the date:
            <br>
            <img alt="A negative COVID-19 test with a phone showing the current date." src="{{ '/static/img/covid/covid19_test_example.png' | relative_url }}" />
          </p>
