            <p>
              In order to keep conference attendees safe, DjangoCon US will require proof of a negative COVID test. We ask that people test again before sprints begin on Thursday. We strongly recommend that people wear a mask and have the latest vaccination boosters. If you are not familiar, we suggest you check out the <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/covid19">CDC's Travel guidelines to stay safe</a>.
              <br />
              <br />
              Scroll down to the <a href="#public-health-policy-tldr">TLDR</a> at the bottom for a condensed version of the following rules.
              <br />
              <br />
              The conference will feature select areas in the talk rooms where attendees will be required to wear masks. These areas will be some distance (but not separated by walls) from non-masked areas to allow diffusion.
              <br />
              <br />
              We are requiring a negative test before coming to the registration desk on your first day of attendance. If you are taking a rapid test, you must take it within 24 hours of your first ticketed day. We will have tests on site if you wish to test when you arrive. If you are taking a PCR test, it must be within 3 days of your first ticketed day (e.g. if you are attending Sunday's sessions, the test must be taken no earlier than Thursday, September 19).
              <br />
              <br />
              We will be sending the testing instructions to in-person ticket-holders prior to the conference.
              <br />
              <br />
              The conference will provide <a href="https://www.stauffersafety.com/Product/3m-9205-bulk-3m-aura-n95-particulate-respirator-mask-701199" target="_blank">N95 masks</a> for people to wear. We recommend that all attendees wear a certified KN95 / N95 respirator mask (with no outflow vent) while inside. If you prefer to wear a surgical mask, we recommend an ASTM Level 3 rated mask.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you prefer to purchase your own PPE, DjangoCon US is offering up to a $50 reimbursement. This should be for higher filtration PPE you acquire yourself (i.e. reusable respirators, etc). Please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact_us_email}}">email us</a> before the conference to coordinate.
              <br />
              <br />
              DjangoCon US reserves the right to increase the requirements of this policy based on COVID-19 infection, hospitalization or positive test rates as reported by the CDC.  We may also be required to alter our policy to conform with local, state, or federal mandates.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you have questions about our Public Health Policy, please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact_us_email}}">email us</a>.

          <p>
            We're asking that all registrants go through the COVID-19 check-in process before registration.
            The COVID-19 registration area will consist of two tables, one for taking tests and the other
            for showing proof of a negative test. Further on will be the conference
            registration desk with your badge.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Acquire recommended N95/KN95 equivalent mask (we have them at the table)</li>
            <li>Take COVID-19 test (follow instructions on the box, perform the test at secondary table or at home/the hotel)</li>
            <li>Show test result or photo of negative test at COVID-19 desk with handwritten note containing the date</li>
            <li>Proceed to registration desk</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            If you have taken a test 24 hours within the start of the conference, you do not have to take
            another test. Here is an example of a negative test with the date:
            <br>
            <img alt="A negative COVID-19 test with a phone showing the current date." src="{{ '/static/img/covid/covid19_test_example.png' | relative_url }}" />
          </p>
