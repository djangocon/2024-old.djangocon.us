# Theme Customization

`THEME-X` is an identifier that has been used to denote where a customization has been made.

## Making changes

1. Modify key variables in `:root` in `main.css`.
2. Look for `THEME-X` comments throughout the codebase and make appropriat changes.


## Design guidelines

1. Sizing, padding, spacing, typography, and general "shape" should stay the same.
2. Colors, fonts, photo treatment, and artistic treatments should be the focus of the theme.
