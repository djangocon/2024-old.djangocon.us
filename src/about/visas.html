      <h2 id="do-i-need-a-visa-to-enter-the-usa">Do I need a visa to enter the USA?</h2>

      <p>That depends on which country issued your passport; see the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit.html">US State Department</a> website for more information.</p>

      <h2 id="i-need-a-letter-to-obtain-a-visa-can-you-help-me-with-that">I need a letter to obtain a visa. Can you help me with that?</h2>

      <p>We sure can! Head over to <a href="/invitation">Get Invitation Letter</a> to request your letter of invitation for your visa application at the US Consulate. You will be required to provide:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Full name (as it appears on your passport)</li>
      <li>Passport number</li>
      <li>Date of birth</li>
      <li>Home address</li>
      <li>Title of talk you’re presenting (if any)</li>
      <li>Amount of opportunity grant funds awarded (if any)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Do this as soon as you can! Wait times to get a visitor visa interview are extremely long (and in some countries are over a year).</p>

      <h2 id="i-cant-get-an-appointment-with-the-us-consulate-in-time-for-the-conference-can-i-get-a-refund">I can’t get an appointment with the US Consulate in time for the conference. Can I get a refund?</h2>

      <p>Send an <a href="mailto:visas@djangocon.us">email</a> to our visa team and we’ll make sure you get taken care of.</p>
