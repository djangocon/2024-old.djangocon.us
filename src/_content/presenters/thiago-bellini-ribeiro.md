I'm a 35-year-old software developer based in Ribeir√£o Preto, Brazil with a passion for Python programming. Since embarking on my software development journey in 2007, I've honed my skills and specialized in Python development since 2011. Over the years, I've collaborated on numerous Python-based applications, always striving to contribute to the open-source community in meaningful ways.

One of my proudest achievements was developing the strawberry-django-plus project in 2021. Additionally, I was appointed a core developer of the Strawberry lib and the official maintainer of the Strawberry-Django integration in 2022. My dedication to the open-source community reflects my commitment to improving software development for everyone.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm known for my positive attitude and willingness to assist others in the community. I enjoy engaging with others and fostering meaningful connections to help propel the industry forward.
