Kojo Idrissa _was_ an accountant who got an MBA and taught at university in
two different countries. He's _now_ a new(ish) software engineer and is still
trying to figure that out and grow into the role. He's spoken at tech conferences
about spreadsheets, contributing to tech communities, Dungeons & Dragons, inclusion
and privilege. You can find him online at http://kojoidrissa.com/ or as
[@kojoidrissa@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@kojoidrissa) on Mastodon.
