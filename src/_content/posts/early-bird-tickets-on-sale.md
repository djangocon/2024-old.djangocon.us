## Hey Django fans! ðŸ‘‹

Tickets for DjangoCon US 2024 in Durham, NC are now on sale.

:ox: **[Buy yours today!]({{ site.ticket_link }})** :ox:

This year we have limited early-bird pricing for individual tickets and corporate tickets. We lowered Individual ticket prices to make the conference more accessible and more affordable so that anyone paying to attend DjangoCon US out of their own pocket can more easily do so.

- Early-bird individual: $339 (full price: $499)
- Early-bird corporate: $699 (full price: $799)

**The early-bird pricing will only be available through the month of May.** Starting June 1st, tickets will be available at their full price.

Purchasing your tickets early not only saves you money, but it also helps organizers prepare for the conference. Besides the obvious factors of knowing how many meals to order and what size projector screens we'll need, it offsets the early payments made to vendors and gives us confidence to enhance and expand the conference experience. If you're able to commit to attending DjangoCon US early, that's fantastic. If you need more time, don't worry; that works for us too.

And lastly, if you're ecstatic about the idea of attending DjangoCon US but need financial assistance to do so, our [Opportunity Grant CFP](/about/opportunity-grants/) is open until April 29th.

We canâ€™t wait to see you in Durham!
