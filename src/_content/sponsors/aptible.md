Aptible is a platform as a service (PaaS) thatâ€™s built for engineering teams who need highly scalable, reliable, and secure infrastructure for their mission critical applications. Our web app and API hosting platform abstracts away any infrastructure complexity, and automates the work of provisioning, managing, and scaling infrastructure, so teams can focus on what actually matters: their product.
