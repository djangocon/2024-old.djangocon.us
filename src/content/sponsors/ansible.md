Automation powered by community.

Ansible is an open source, command-line IT automation software application written in Python. It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate advanced workflows to support application deployment, system updates, and more.

Open source and collaboration are at the heart of the Ansible community. Ansible Core + Collections, Ansible Galaxy, AWX, and other upstream projects to Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform are created by — and supported with — contributions from active community members to solve automation challenges that fuel enterprise innovation.
