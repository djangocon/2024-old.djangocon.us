  A web dev shop started by some friends out of college that grew into an employee-owned, self-directed agency working across governmental systems, social impact organizations, and other industries with a specialty for Django and Python development. We're curious and we love meeting interesting people. If you want to trade stories, share clever ideas about the future of work, or compare opportunities , schedule an exploratory chat with our Chief of Curation!
