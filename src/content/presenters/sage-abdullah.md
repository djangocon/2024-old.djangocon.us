I'm Sage and I'm from Jakarta, Indonesia.

In 2019, I participated in Google Summer of Code with Django, during which I implemented the [cross-database `JSONField`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/fields/#jsonfield) that became available in Django 3.1.

Now, I'm based in the UK and I work at Torchbox, building new features and improvements to the Django-powered [Wagtail CMS](https://wagtail.org) and its ecosystem.

Outside of the Django world, I maintain my project [giscus](https://giscus.app), a comment system powered by GitHub Discussions.

You can find me @laymonage on [GitHub](https://github.com/laymonage), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/laymonage), and other sites. I'd love to make friends from around the world, so hit me up!
