Scott is currently a full-stack web developer at NASA's [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) (JPL), where his team uses Django to power the main JPL website, the JPL Space intranet, and a large number of other internal websites. He's also a member of the core team for [Wagtail](https://wagtail.org/), the CMS used on all of the above JPL sites, and is also a part of its accessibility subteam.

Prior to coming to JPL, Scott was part of the inaugural class of Design & Technology Fellows at the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/), where Django powered [the CFPB's first open source repo](https://github.com/cfpb/transit_subsidy), released in 2012, and Wagtail was chosen for rebuilding [consumerfinance.gov](https://github.com/cfpb/consumerfinance.gov) in 2015.
