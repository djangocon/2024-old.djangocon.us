## Hey Django fans! ðŸ‘‹

Tickets for DjangoCon US 2024 in Durham, NC are now on sale. [Buy yours today!]({{ site.ticket_link }})

This year we have limited early-bird pricing for individual tickets and corporate tickets.

- Early-bird individual: $339 (full price: $499)
- Early-bird corporate: $699 (full price: $799)

The early-bird pricing will only be available through the month of May. On June 1st, tickets will only be available at their full price.

### A request from the organizers

Weâ€™re offering early-bird pricing this year for a few reasons. First, it provides a lower cost for folks to attend. Second, early ticket purchases are a tremendous boon to conference organizers. Third, it allows for you to take part in promotional activities. Fourth, weâ€™re looking to encourage people to make earlier commitments to attend.

If youâ€™ve attended DjangoCon US before and have been looking for a way to express your gratitude, please purchase your ticket early. Knowing thereâ€™s a baseline allows conference organizers to make decisions confidently on a variety of questions. It ranges from meal quantities to projector screen sizes. It also helps us balance the checkbook, since most vendors require payment well before the event.

So if youâ€™d like to lessen the stress and worry on your conference organizers, particularly Peter, please purchase your conference tickets sooner rather than later.
