<!-- Todo: Need dates and where to submit proposals. Also need to update the link to the CFP. -->
We are excited that DjangoCon US 2024 is now open for talk submissions: [call for proposals](https://pretalx.com/djangocon-2023/cfp)! The deadline for submissions is May 15th, 2023 at [6 PM EDT](https://time.is/0600PM_15_May_2023_in_Durham,_United_States?DjangoCon_US_CFP_Closes).

We invite you to submit your proposal no matter your background or experience level with Django. Proposals can be from a wide range of topics; non-Django and community topics are welcome. You can look at our [talk schedule](https://2023.djangocon.us/talks/) from last year for reference.

We fancy first-timers! If you haven’t spoken at a conference or given a tutorial before, this is your invitation to do so. Don’t let the idea that you’re not famous or an expert stop you from submitting. It certainly won’t stop us from selecting your talk or tutorial and it won’t stop the audience from enjoying it! Please contact one of our amazing [speaker mentors](https://2023.djangocon.us/speaking/speaker-resources/) to help you on your way.
<!-- Todo: Add link to correct opportunity grant form. -->
Plus there are perks! Presenters get free admission to DjangoCon US! Grants to assist with your travel and lodging expenses are available as well. Fill out the [Opportunity Grant](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yc1HqqcJwi669vxTTs1daJbTeiNYwqM2h3gIgqbpWVE/viewform) form by May 15th, 2023. Decision notifications will be sent by June 28, 2023.

For more information on talk and tutorial formats, please check out our [speaker information page](https://2024.djangocon.us/speaking/).

We want everyone attending DjangoCon US to feel safe, welcome, and included. To that end, we have a [Code of Conduct](https://2024.djangocon.us/conduct/) for all speakers and attendees.

If you have questions feel free [to contact us](mailto:hello@djangocon.us).

We look forward to your proposals!
